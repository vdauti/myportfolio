					<h2>Experience</h2>
						For the past 4 years I've worked as a customer service rep., an emergency medical technician and I finally lead myself to become good at investing on niches that work for me.

			<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>
						After high school I started out in a community college known as Passaic County Community College because it was more affordable for me. I ended up completing all my Gen Ed's and thought I wanted to be in the medical field until I ended up with an injury preventing a patient from falling. I was sure I didn't want that to happen to me again so I ended up searching for other career fields. I always liked being on computers and working with them but I never knew as much as I really wanted to. I then lead myself to finding different schools such as PC AGE Career Institute which I am using to obtain various IT certifications for college credit while learning how to code at Rutger's New Brunswick.
